In this project, Python scripts were created to accomplish analytical tasks for specific scenarios.

## PyBank

A Python script was created for analyzing the financial records of a company. The script calculates each of the following: 
	* The total number of months included in the dataset
	* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

	* The total number of votes cast
	* A complete list of candidates who received votes
	* The percentage of votes each candidate won
	* The total number of votes each candidate won
	* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## PyBoss

A Python script was created to convert the employee records to the required format of a new human resources system. The script does each of the following:
	* The `Name` column is split into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns
	* The `DOB` data is re-written into `MM/DD/YYYY` format
	* The `SSN` data is re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view
	* The `State` data is re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations

## PyParagraph

A Python script was created to automate the analysis of any passage of writing using a simple set of metrics for assessing complexity. The script assesses the 
passage for each of the following: 
	* Approximate word count
	* Approximate sentence count
	* Approximate letter count (per word)
	* Average sentence length (in words)
